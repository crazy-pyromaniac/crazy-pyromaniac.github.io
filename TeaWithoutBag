<p><srong>I made some tea without the bag.</strong><br><br>

Put 1 cup of water in a pot (5 seconds in my sink).<br>
Place the pot on a stove set to high.<br>
Open and empty the tea bag into the pot.<br>
When the water simmers, set the temperature to low.<br>
Stir the water for five minutes, while maintaining a simmer.<br>
Strain the tea.<br><br>

After I tried green tea in several asian-themed restaurants, I was surprised at how much better it<br>
was than the tea I made at home with a kettle and tea bag. In comparison to the smoother taste of<br>
the restaurants’ tea, my own tea tasted bitter and watery. My guess as to why mine was worse was<br>
the way I prepared it: pouring boiling water into a cup with a tea bag. Perhaps the tea leaves were<br>
scolded before they released their flavor.<br><br>

My hypothetical solution to this problem was to remove boiling from the process, and steep the tea<br>
directly on the stove. I had to remove the tea from the bag, as the bag would not stay beneath the 
surface.<br>

I’ll have to try the tea against my usual preparation method and with a cleaner mouth, to see if this<br>
is a truly better tea. But when I tasted it, it seemed to have no bitter taste, even in the dregs.<br>
Although the tea had much less aroma, it also seemed to have a smoother, cohesive taste overall.</p>

I did let the water boil slightly while making it, which may have affected my test.
